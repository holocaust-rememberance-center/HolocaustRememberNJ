      <h2>Life and Loss in Germany: The 80th Anniversary of Kristallnacht</h2>


      Jewish life thrived in Germany, the birthplace of Reform Judaism, for centuries. Enlightenment, progress, and continuity defined Jews’ outlook and practice. Influential and inspiring thinkers hailed from German lands, also known as the historical Ashkenaz. Rooted in German language
      and culture, but determined to preserve their own religious and cultural identities, German Jews integrated into German society. However, ambivalence toward Jews and antisemitism persisted.

<h3>Jewish Life in Germany</h3>
Rabbinic decisions made in the medieval center of Ashkenazi Jewish life in German lands reverberated throughout European Jewish communities. Haskalah, the Jewish response to Enlightenment, radiated from German lands in the 18th century. For its proponents, Judaism and
secular pursuits were complementary. By the 19th century, many German Jews had embraced Reform Judaism, whose emphasis on the changing nature of Jewish life and the need to adapt Jewish practice, paved the way for ordaining the first female rabbi, Regina Jonas, in 1935. The concept of Bildung, self-cultivation and German cultural facility, appealed to Jews. With Germany becoming a unified country in 1871, Jewish life blossomed. Jews were culture producers and consumers, innovators, business people, and members of the intelligentsia. However, Jews’ attempts to enter the German society aroused suspicion and outright hatred. German thinkers accused Jews and Jewishness of infiltrating German culture and contaminating it. Close to 100,000 German Jews fought in World War I. Yet Jews were blamed for Germany’s defeat. In response to rising nationalism, some Jews turned to Zionism. Still, most of the 500,000 Jews in Germany identified primarily as German.


With the imposition of legislation such as the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, Jews assumed an inferior status in Nazi Germany. Kristallnacht shattered Jews’ lives. German Jews were outside the protection of the law. Determined to solve the “Jewish Question,” the Nazi regime forced
about 300,000 Jews to emigrate from Germany by September 1939. Jews who stayed experienced exclusion from all areas of life. About 400 anti-Jewish laws were enacted in the first six years of the Nazi rule. Jews were expropriated through Aryanization, the transfer of Jewish ownership onto Aryan Germans at prices below market value. Another wave of laws stripped Jews of their identity, forcing those without Jewish-sounding names to add the names “Sarah” for women and “Israel” for men, and affixed the letter ”J” to Jews’ identity cards. By September 1941, Jews had to display a yellow Star of David.

  Visibly marked and confined to houses designated only for them, German Jews were easily controlled by the regime. Deportations of Jews from Germany accelerated in October 1941, with trains taking Jews to ghettos and camps in Eastern Europe. In spring 1943, Germany was declared “free of Jews.” Up to 180,000 German Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.
