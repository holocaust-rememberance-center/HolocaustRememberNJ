      <h1> Peter Lederman Story</h1>
      <p>
      Peter Lederman lived in Gotha, Germany, with his parents and maternal grandmother. Peter’s father, Ernst, owned a successful accounting practice. After Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, Peter, then only 2 years old, experienced increased persecution.

During class, Peter and the few Jewish students in his school were forced to sit together in a corner. November 9, 1938 proceeded as usual. Peter went to school, and returned home. But, around midnight, Peter heard his grandmother and mother shouting with some men in black SS uniforms. Peter’s grandmother put her hand over his mouth to quiet him, as Peter, frightened, was screaming. Earlier that night, the SS had taken his father away while Peter was asleep. However, the SS-men returned, searching for his father, who, they claimed, had escaped. The commotion woke Peter up and scared him. The next morning, Peter discovered that his father was in a concentration camp, at Buchenwald. The family knew nothing, not when he would return, or if ever.</p>
<p>
Kristallnacht changed Peter’s life completely. He could no longer attend his German public school. Instead, he went to a makeshift school organized by the local Jewish community. He was no longer allowed to play outside. An adult had to accompany him at all times. Fortunately, Peter’s father returned home after a week. The Minister of Finance obtained a release for him so that Ernst would continue to do taxes, a work the Nazis deemed vital to their interests. Soon after his return, Ernst managed to leave Germany and find refuge in England. Peter and his mother followed thereafter.

<h2>The Journey That Saved My Life</h2>
</p>
<p>
<div class="imgr">

Now the German air stewardess pushes her trolley down the aisle offering drinks and stops to chat. “It was British European Airlines in those days,” he says.  “And a very different aeroplane.  It was a DC3. Much smaller – I think.”</p>
<p>
	“Ah yes,” she says. “The good old days.”  He smiles politely and doesn’t bother to correct her.  The Ledermans are Jewish.</p>
  <p>
	Sixty years ago, he and his mother, with their identity cards stamped with a big yellow J, boarded the plane and didn’t allow themselves a sigh of relief until they were in the sky.
  </p>
  <p>They escaped.  It was a journey that in all probability saved their lives and it almost didn’t happen.
  </p>
  <p>Peter’s father was sent to Buchenwald concentration camp in 1938. But he was one of the few prisoners to be released, “terribly thin, with a shaven head.”  Ministry of Finance, in the process of requisitioning all stocks and bonds owned by Jews, decided that his skills as an accountant and contacts in the Jewish community would be useful.
  </p>
  <p>He was let out but knew it was only a matter of time before he was arrested again.  Sponsored by relations in London, in early 1939 he escaped Germany, leaving behind his seven-year-old son, Peter, and his wife.
  </p>
  <p>It took months for mother and child to get the necessary documents to leave.  Carrying one suitcase each, they left their family, their home and most possessions in the small town of Gotha.
  </p>
  <p>They had passports, exit visas, entry visas for Britain and tickets to London.  They were strip-searched and X-rayed to make sure that they hadn’t swallowed anything of value. Then they waited.
  </p>
  <p>“Can you imagine being seven years old and seeing your mother stripped in front of you, and then stripped and searched yourself?” says Peter.
  </p>
  <p>But the immigration officials found a fault with their documents.  The time for the plane to depart drew closer.  And then it passes.  The immigration guards wired Berlin to check their papers.  An hour went by.  Then, down the wire came the reply: the Ledermans were free to go.
  </p>
  <p>And the pilot had waited for them.  “He must have realized what was happening to us,” Peter recalls.  “Nobody would do that today.  You can’t keep a plane waiting for an hour-and-a-half for two passengers.”
  </p>
  <p>They ran out and got the last two seats on the plane. “They were facing backwards, I remember that.  And the courtesy shown to my mother and me by the BEA crew,” says Peter.
  </p>
  <p>Apart from the fear and huge sense of relief, he also remembers his excitement at his first journey in an aeroplane.
  </p>
  <p>They stopped in Brussels and at dusk, landed in Croydon, London’s civil airport at the time. They had survived and a simple act of humanity by a nameless pilot had made it possible.
  </p>
  <p>His grandparents, his great-aunt and his great-uncle didn’t make the flight.  Denied visas to England, they stayed in Gotha.  They were sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp, where all four perished.
  </p>
  <p>Since then Peter has taken hundreds to flights in the course of his career working for the US federal government - the family emigrated to America.  But no trip was more important than that first one.
  </p>
  <p>Retracing the route on the anniversary, he says, is not just a way of remembering the past but of celebrating being alive.  “It just isn’t possible to re-live the journey,” he says.  “I could never re-live it. But I need to remember.”
  </p>
  <p>His son, Stuart, a 38-year-old lawyer in New York, and his daughter, Ellen, an investment banker who lives in Prague, come alone to remember too.
  </p>
  <p>“In Judaism we believe that you have to remember because if you forget then it will happen again, if not to the Jews then to some other people,” says Stuart.
  </p>
  <p>“I could never go through what he went through.  And I never had a chance to talk to my grandparents about it.  I was too young, and then they died.”
  </p>
  <p>Their mother, Peter’s wife, was a survivor too.  She was in hiding in the Slovakian countryside and went to America only after the war, in 1948.
  </p>
  <p>“There were so many close calls on both sides,” says Ellen.
  </p>
  <p>“Children of survivors have a consciousness of them,” says Stuart.
	</p>
  <p>hey know that if that pilot had refused to wait at Cologne airport they would not be sitting here today.
  </p>
  <p>But the one who had the closest call with death is their father’s cousin, Klaus. Aged nine, he saw Peter and his mother to the airport.
  </p>
  <p>Klaus was classified as mischling (mixed Jewish, second degree) because his mother was Jewish and his father Lutheran.  It was still dangerous for him, but not as dangerous as it had been for Peter and his mother.
  </p>
  <p>Their relations in England could not afford to sponsor all the family, so Klaus and his mother were left behind.
  </p>
  <p>“My mother was obviously happy that they were getting out, but it meant losing her sister,” says Peter. “They didn’t know if they would ever see each other again.”
  </p>
  <p>Klaus recorded the date in a card-index box along with his other near-misses: the day he was on his way to Dresden when it was bombed by the British; the day the family left Dusseldorf shortly before all Jews were rounded up; the day they left east Germany just before the Allies pulled out and the Russians moved in.
  </p>
  <p>“We said goodbye at the railway station, but it was only me who went to say goodbye to my grandparents,” says Peter. “I was the only one they wanted to see. They felt they were being abandoned.”
  </p>
  <p>Nobody knew what happened to his grandparents until 1944, when they were notified of their deaths.
  </p>
  <p>Klaus and Peter didn’t meet again until 1955. Nobody mentioned the war. Neither boy’s parents ever discussed what happened.  “They just wouldn’t talk about it. They were the children of parents who had finished their lives in Theresienstadt,” says Peter.
  </p>
  <p>After a few months with a distant aunt and uncle in London, the Ledermans decided to go to America.  But Peter developed appendicitis, and authorities would not let him get on the ship – a lucky escape as it was torpedoed and the family would have perished.  A few months later the family left and finally reached New York – nine months after leaving Cologne.
  </p>
  <p>This is not Paul Lederman’s first trip back to Germany, but he has always approached it with mixed feelings. “I used to come on business but it was always a relief to get in the plane and leave,” he says.
  </p>
  <p>His German is rusty now but he tries it on the air stewardess.  “Where did you learn it?” she asks.  “It would take too long to explain,” he says.  “I was born here.”  She smiles, puzzled.  “I used ot be German,” he says.
  </p>
  <p>Sitting in business class surrounded by stolid German businessmen, I ask him how he feels about the country of his birth.
  </p>
  <p>“For many years I just wanted to take a machinegun and kill them all,” he says softly. The man sitting one row down hears him, looks up, then goes back to his Suddeutsche Zeitung.
